We accidentally built the world's most accessible combat robot in 2 weeks.

Players can sit down from anywhere in the world, open their phone and control 3 combat robots in my bedroom.

## ComfySpace {{  date: '2023-03-01T00:00Z' }}

Having been in love with robotics, I realized how cumbersome developing hardware is. So I built ComfySpace, an application to solve it.

ComfySpace is an application that enables easy remote control and monitoring of Raspberry Pi and IoT projects through customizable buttons and simple scripting, minimizing the need for additional hardware or complex programming.
